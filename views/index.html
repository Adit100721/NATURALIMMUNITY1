            Ashwagandha is an evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa. It is commonly used for stress. There is little evidence for its use as an "adaptogen.".Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.Since ashwagandha is traditionally used as an adaptogen, it is used for many conditions related to stress. Adaptogens are believed to help the body resist physical and mental stress. Some of the conditions it is used for include insomnia, aging, anxiety and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ashwagandha for COVID-19.

            <p class="fst-italic">
             Amla's high concentration of Vitamin C helps your body produce norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter believed to improve brain function in people with dementia.The antioxidants and vitamins found in amla berries offer several health benefits. High concentrations of vitamin C in amla helps the body recover from illness. Amla berries also include several flavonols, chemicals that have been linked to benefits like improved memory. The soluble fiber in amla berries dissolves quickly in the body, which helps to slow the rate your body absorbs sugar. This can help reduce blood sugar spikes. Amla berries also have a positive effect on blood glucose and lipid counts in people with type 2 diabetes.Amla berries are rich in vitamin A, which is key to improving eye health. Vitamin A not only improves vision, but it also may lower the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Amla's vitamin C content aids in eye health by fighting bacteria, which can help to protect your eyes from conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other infections. Apart from being a storehouse of antioxidants, amla is enriched with micronutrients that are an immunity booster. Amla acts as a detoxifying agent for the body and it improves your heart, eyesight, hair, diabetic conditions. For weight watchers, consider Amla for its high fibre content that can aid in weight loss.
